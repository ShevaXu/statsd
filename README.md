# statsd

> StatsD is a simple daemon for aggregating application metrics.

*StatsD* was initialized by Flickr and *Cal Henderson* posted about it, [*Counting and timing*](http://code.flickr.com/blog/2008/10/27/counting-timing/), with the Perl [code](https://github.com/iamcal/Flickr-StatsD). 
Now [etsy/statsd](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) (Node.js) is the main reference repo.
